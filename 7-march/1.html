    artificial intelligence
</h1>
<p>
    <pre>
artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to
perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing 
systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the 
ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital 
computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated
 that computers can be programmed to carry out very  
complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite
continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility 
over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. 
On the other hand, some programs have attained the
performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence 
in this limited sense
is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition.

    What is intelligence?
</h1>
<p><pre>
    All but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated insect behaviour 
    is never taken as an indication of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger wasp, Sphex 
    ichneumoneus. When the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the threshold, checks for
     intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the wasp’s
      instinctual behaviour is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow
       while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced. 
    Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of Sphex—must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.

            Methods and goals in AI
        </h1>
        <p><pre>
            Symbolic vs. connectionist approaches
            AI research follows two distinct, and to some extent competing, methods, the symbolic (or “top-down”) approach, and the
             connectionist (or “bottom-up”) approach. The top-down approach seeks to replicate intelligence by analyzing cognition 
             independent of the biological structure of the brain, in terms of the processing of symbols—whence the symbolic label. 
             The bottom-up approach, on the other hand, involves creating artificial
             neural networks in imitation of the brain’s structure—whence the connectionist label.
